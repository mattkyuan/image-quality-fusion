# Minimal usage example for the Image Quality Fusion model

## Installation
```bash
pip install huggingface_hub torch torchvision pillow opencv-python open-clip-torch
```

## Usage
```python
from huggingface_hub import PyTorchModelHubMixin

# Load the model (this will download it automatically)
model = PyTorchModelHubMixin.from_pretrained("matthewyuan/image-quality-fusion")

# Predict image quality (1-10 scale)
quality_score = model.predict_quality("path/to/your/image.jpg")
print(f"Image quality: {quality_score:.2f}/10")

# Batch prediction
scores = model.predict_batch(["img1.jpg", "img2.jpg", "img3.jpg"])
for i, score in enumerate(scores, 1):
    print(f"Image {i}: {score:.2f}/10")
```

## What it does
- Combines BRISQUE (technical quality), Aesthetic Predictor, and CLIP features
- Trained on 11K smartphone photos with human quality ratings
- Achieves 0.52 correlation with human judgments
- Fast inference (~0.7s per image after initial load)
